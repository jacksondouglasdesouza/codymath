# Security Policy for Cody Math

The Cody Math team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are committed to working with the community to verify and respond to any potential vulnerabilities that are reported to us.

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of the following private methods:

1.  **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting:** The preferred method for reporting vulnerabilities is through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature. This will ensure your report is directly and confidentially sent to the project maintainers. You can submit a report by going to the "Security" tab of our repository and clicking "Report a vulnerability".

2.  **Private Email:** If you prefer, you can send an email directly to **`codymath@proton.me`**. Please provide us with a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.

You can expect to receive an initial response from us within 48 hours.

## Proactive Security Measures

To ensure the security of our library, we employ the following proactive measures:

* **Dependency Monitoring:** We use **GitHub Dependabot** to automatically scan our dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Dependabot alerts us to any risks and helps us keep all packages up-to-date with the latest security patches.

* **Regular Audits:** In addition to automated monitoring, our team performs regular security audits of our dependencies using the `npm audit` command to identify and address potential issues.
